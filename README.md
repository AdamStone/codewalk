# codewalk

### Walk step-by-step through the development of code projects

Codewalk is a web application providing an alternative view of GitHub repositories that makes it easy to step through the entire history of a project and quickly view what changed with each commit. 

This can be useful for any project, but its main motivation is to leverage git and GitHub as a framework for creating and hosting high quality code tutorials that walk through the process of building full applications from scratch, showing the evolution of the source code with each step.

### Demo
